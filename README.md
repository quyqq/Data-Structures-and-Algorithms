Case study:

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) defines a homeless as a person 
“who does not have suitable accommodation and whose current living arrangement: 
is in a dwelling that is inadequate, has no tenure
is where the initial tenure is short and not extendable
does not allow the person to have control of, and access to space for social relations”. 
On Census night in 2016, more than 116,000 people were estimated to be homeless in 
Australia—58% were male, 21% were aged 25–34 and 20% identified as Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander Australians (ABS 2018). As of June 2016, there were 194,592 applicants 
waiting for social housing across the country’s social housing programs (Patterson, 2017). 
Specialist Homelessness Services (SHS) are charity and government funded organisations 
working to support homeless people. 
End Homelessness (EH) is a newly registered SHS who is determined to tackle the problem 
of homelessness in innovative ways by using information and communication technology to 
collect data, increase advocacy and if needed employ crowd funding to raise money. The very 
basic requirement for addressing the issue is to have accurate information on each homeless 
person. Therefore, the directors have decided to have a Homeless Information System (HIS) 
which is reliable, flexible, and expandable.
